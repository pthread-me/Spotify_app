[Verse 1]
When we're out in a crowd
Laughin' loud and nobody knows why
When we're lost at a club
Gettin' drunk and you give me that smile
Goin' home in the back of a car
And your hand touches mine
When we're done makin' love
And you look up and give me those eyes

[Chorus]
'Cause all of the small things that you do
Are what remind me why I fell for you
And when we're apart and I'm missin' you
I close my eyes and all I see is you
And the small things you do

[Verse 2]
When you call me at night
While you're out gettin' high with your friends (Out with your friends)
Every "hi", every "bye"
Every "I love you" you've ever said (You've ever said)

[Chorus]
'Cause all of the small things that you do
Are what remind me why I fell for you
And when we're apart and I'm missin' you
I close my eyes and all I see is you
And the small things you do

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
When we're done makin' love
And you look up and give me those eyes

[Chorus]
'Cause all of the small things that you do
Are what remind me why I fell for you
And when we're apart and I'm missin' you
I close my eyes and all I see is you
And the small things you do

[Outro]
All the small things you do
