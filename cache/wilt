[Verse 1]
"Could you fade away just as quickly as you came?
You're a burnt bouquet
There's nothing left to say
Simply dissipate, dissolve or just decay
You're a burnt bouquet
There's nothing left for me to say"

[Chorus]
Hold me now for a little bit
Burn it down, get it over with
If I admit that our lives were doomed to entwine
I'd turn back the time for your peace of mind
Hold me now, for a little bit
The love that we watched wilt

[Verse 2]
"Could you fade away just as quickly as you came?
You're a burnt bouquet
There's nothing left to say"

[Chorus]
Hold me now for a little bit
Burn it down, get it over with
If I admit that our lives were doomed to entwine
I'd turn back the time for your peace of mind
Hold me now for a little bit
The love that we watched wilt

[Bridge]
Whenever I see the tapestry your blessed hands had wove for me
The poetry, the misery
It all meant so, so much to me
Just give me a lobotomy and cure these things inside of me, and maybe I can be free to love you for an eternity
If in another life my heart is beating fine and love is on my mind... You'll be the first in line
Whenever I see the tapestry your blessed hands had wove for me
The poetry, the misery
It all meant so, so much to me
Just give me a lobotomy and cure these things inside of me, so maybe I can be free to love you for an eternity

[Outro]
Whenever I see the tapestry your blessed hands had wove for me
The poetry, the misery
It all meant so, so much to me
Just give me a lobotomy and cure these things inside of me, so maybe I can be free to love you for an eternity
